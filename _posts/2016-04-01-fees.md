For Detoxification and Health Consultations including a full health assessment questionnaire and an optional herbal protocol write up, the 90 minute consultation fee is $150.00\.

For subsequent consultations or for non-health related counselling (1 hour): $95.00\.

All consultations, email replies and questions take place Monday to Friday.

Sessions are carried out on Skype or any internet telephony program you prefer. A headset is recommended for sound quality. We can use webcam if you would like, or no webcam, whatever you're most comfortable with.

Everything discussed is confidential under counselling ethics.

**Please note that being vegan, I do not work with or have any experience in working with animal glandulars so if you would like a protocol written up for you it will be a herbal protocol. If you would prefer to work with animal glandulars as well as herbs, I will be happy to recommend another practitioner for you.**
