**Blog**I will write about how increasing your awareness of conditioning and your environment can dramatically change your perspective and give you back a sense of control. Not all posts will be directly about counselling but rather helping you see things differently. The focus is awareness and this is the foundation of good counselling. Being psychology based there will always be more to add but my aim is to write short summaries in an accessible way .

Much of what I write about is health related. I want to stress that it is ALL my opinion. I encourage you to look for the truth within yourself.

I am also a Detoxification and Health Specialist. Along with supporting clients with detoxification, I also help with the many issues that arise from the physical to the emotional.

**Counselling**Personally I believe you should never take advice, from anybody. We all have our own view of the world through our own subjective experience and any advice given by another individual, even the closest of friends, can only ever be seeing your problem through their eyes. This doesn't mean that listening to other people's experiences and perspectives isn't helpful, it can be insightful and very often extremely useful. But there is a world of difference between exploring options and blindly doing something somebody tells you, albeit with the best intentions.

My goal is to look at your issues from different perspectives and help you discover what obstacles prevent you moving from where you are now, to where you want to be. Certainly it can take a little time to build rapport and trust in order to communicate openly and honestly, but I will never have you rely on me in terms of endless sessions. Ultimately my aim is to empower you to help yourself.

Whether you'd like to focus on something specific or just need someone to talk to in total confidence, please do get in contact.

**Detoxification & Health Consultations**If you are looking to get your health back, no matter the ailments, true detoxification is the golden key. The initial consultation will include looking at your completed health questionnaire that I will send to you before we chat for the first time. I will advise you on diet and other aspects of your journey with a structured protocol. I will be there to guide you for as long as you need me to.
