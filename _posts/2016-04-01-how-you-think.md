We categorise everything. Our minds are filled with categories and everything we understand is based on how we group information together. This process is automatic and it is this that I'd like to highlight because being involuntary makes it extremely powerful.

It appears that, in various forms, categorisation occurs across species so it's safe to assume it's the most efficient way nature has provided of understanding the world.

This method means that you don't have to keep re-evaluating everything as though it were the first time. When you go for a job interview, you have an understanding that you shouldn't dress like a clown, unless you're going to a circus. But it isn't just knowing what to do in any situation. You think in terms of categories all the time. Words that we hear or read trigger categories within us. Check out these:

George W. Bush, Vegetarianism. Middle East conflicts. Religion, Hunting.

All of this list will trigger a category in your mind, some may be more emotive than others. This process is like a reflex, you can't stop it. We can see how this works in our favour; it's quick and allows minimal processing time as we can link it to what we already know which further reinforces or adapts the category for future use.

You're actually already aware of this to some extent. Remember the last time you thought carefully before saying something because you didn't want to come across the 'wrong way'? This is you knowing that something you say can trigger a category in another person, but you're aware that it isn't the category you want to bring to their mind, so you look for other ways to express yourself so they think of the category you want them to bring to mind. This is one example, yet it happens all the time, in every communication and all the time you're listening, reading and just being alive.

The more we look at this the more we see that cultures, beliefs and the media contribute to creating and shaping our categories. Advertising agencies and marketing departments work hard to ensure their products are linked with positive categories. Politicians say what they think we want to hear triggering positive categories, especially when they want our vote.

We're scared of the 'unknown' whether it be an illness doctors are unable to define or perhaps when your boss tells you that there will be some 'big changes'. Until we know at least enough to trigger something in our minds, we become anxious because we simply don't know, we don't have a category ready, no plan of action as to how we might respond.

This process does have it's limitations. It acts like a filter on a camera lens, everything you see, hear, feel, smell and taste is linked in your mind's filing system so it's subjective. When you're arguing with someone and they accuse you of, 'not listening' it's usually because the point that they have just made represents one of their categories, but it's theirs, not yours. You only hear the words and these trigger your own, and thus, different category. It's a little like somebody telling you that you don't love them any more and to you that sounds absurd. You both have your own definitions of what love is, you just haven't raised the discussion to that level of awareness so you're merely exchanging box labels, not the contents that contain the real essence and nature of the conversation.

As you spend time recognising these thought patterns you'll see it influences everything you do. It isn't all negative but it's extremely useful to be constantly aware of why you think the way you do. Raise your level of awareness so you recognise where a certain opinion comes from, are you just regurgitating something you've just heard? What was your position before you heard it? Take that extra time when somebody says something to think about what else they could have meant, particularly during a disagreement. What is the source of your thinking? There is certainly an argument that we can never be rid of such thought patterns, after all, it appears to be natural so what's the problem? This isn't so much about breaking free, it's more about spending an occasional moment to think about why you behave and think the way you do. Focus on your awareness and enjoy examining not so much as to who you are, but why you are.
